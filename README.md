# Claude Code Context Engineering Template

A comprehensive template repository for enhancing projects with advanced Claude Code capabilities through Context Engineering patterns, security safeguards, and structured development workflows.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is the practice of designing and implementing systems that provide AI assistants with rich, structured context about your project, enabling more accurate, consistent, and effective assistance. This repository provides a complete framework for:

- **Structured Documentation**: Standardized formats for PRDs, planning documents, and task breakdowns
- **Security-First Approach**: Automated safeguards against dangerous operations
- **Workflow Optimization**: Streamlined development processes with built-in quality gates
- **Project Intelligence**: Self-documenting systems that Claude can understand and work with effectively

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use as Template (Recommended for New Projects)

```bash
# Create new project from template
git clone https://github.com/mrmarbury/cc_ctx_eng.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from Context Engineering template"

# Install dependencies
brew install uv python@3.11

# Test hook functionality
uv run .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py < /dev/null
```

### Option 2: Copy to Existing Project

```bash
# Copy .claude directory to existing project
cp -r /path/to/cc_ctx_eng/.claude /path/to/your/existing/project/

# Install dependencies
cd /path/to/your/existing/project
brew install uv python@3.11

# Test setup
uv run .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py < /dev/null
```

### Option 3: Git Submodule (Advanced)

```bash
# Add as submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/your-org/cc_ctx_eng.git .claude-template
cp -r .claude-template/.claude .
```

4. **`/create-tasks`** - Milestone-based task breakdown

#### Standalone Specification Workflow

- **`/prp-spec-create`** - Create standalone specifications with checkboxes
- **`/prp-spec-execute`** - Execute specifications with progress tracking

### ðŸ”§ Language-Specific Commands

- **`/Elixir:create-spec`** - Elixir standalone specifications with OTP patterns
- **`/Elixir:create-prd`** - Elixir PRDs with supervision tree architecture
- **`/Elixir:create-claude-md`** - Elixir development guide with GenServer patterns
- **`/Elixir:create-planning`** - OTP architecture and Phoenix framework planning
- **`/Elixir:create-tasks`** - Elixir task breakdown with fault tolerance focus

### ðŸŽ¯ Quality Assurance

## Best Practices

### Context Engineering Principles

1. **Start with Context**: Always begin sessions with `/prime` to load project context
2. **Document Everything**: Use the 4-step planning process for comprehensive documentation
3. **Iterate Intelligently**: Use specification workflows for focused improvements
4. **Maintain Quality**: Leverage built-in review and testing standards

### Development Workflow

1. **Session Initialization**: `/prime` to understand project structure
2. **Task Planning**: Use appropriate planning commands for your project type
3. **Implementation**: Follow task breakdowns with checkbox tracking
4. **Quality Assurance**: Use review commands before commits
5. **Session Completion**: `/summary-clear` to document progress

### Security Guidelines

- Always use `.env.sample` for template environment files
- Review hook logs regularly for security insights
- Test dangerous operations in safe environments first
- Keep hooks updated and monitor for security patches

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Hook Failures

```bash
# Check logs for details
ls -la logs/

# Verify uv installation
uv --version

# Test hook manually
uv run .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py < /dev/null
```

#### Permission Issues

```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la .claude/hooks/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.py
```

#### TTS Issues

```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

# Test TTS manually
uv run .claude/hooks/notification.py --notify
```

    # Add your custom logic here
    return True
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Create environment-specific settings:
