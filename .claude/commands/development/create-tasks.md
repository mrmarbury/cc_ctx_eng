# Create Project Task Breakdown

## Milestone Focus: $ARGUMENTS

Generate a comprehensive TASKS.md that breaks down your project into actionable, milestone-driven tasks. This transforms the high-level planning into specific, trackable work items for development.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have completed the full planning workflow:
1. `/create-prd` - Project requirements and scope
2. `/create-claude-md` - Development context and tech stack  
3. `/create-planning` - Architecture and implementation strategy

## Task Generation Process

### 1. Document Analysis
- Extract implementation phases from PLANNING.md
- Identify key deliverables and dependencies from PRD.md
- Review technical requirements from CLAUDE.md
- Map tasks to architectural components

### 2. Task Breakdown Strategy
- Break down phases into specific, actionable tasks
- Organize tasks by milestone and priority
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Estimate effort and complexity
- Assign task categories and labels

### 3. Milestone Planning
- Define clear milestone objectives
- Set milestone success criteria
- Plan milestone deliverables
- Identify milestone dependencies and blockers

## TASKS.md Template Structure

Generate a comprehensive task breakdown following this structure:
